A square bouncing game where 2 squares fight eachother,
When squares hit eachother they both lose 1 life,
When a square collects a heal they gain back 1 life if not at 10 already,
When a square collects a invincibility they dont take damage but still deal damage for 2-ish seconds,
When a square collects a speed up, they speed up,
When a squate collects a slow down, they slow down,
Last one standing wins.

You can customize the color, speed, size and what powerups spawn on the left

Presets for settings,

Deathmatch,
Quickmatch,
Wallstrat-faceoff (wallstrat is explained below this).

-----------------------------

WALLSTRAT

This is when a square gos into a wall (def not a bug that I turned into a feature),
It is risky because it wont allow the square to get powerups and can even eject the square (auto lose),
Once the square is out of the wall, it usually gives them a massive UNCAPPED speedboost.
